## Project Overview
This project implements a student registration system with an accessible form, inline validation, dynamic profile cards, and a synchronized summary table. The application uses semantic HTML, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, adhering to the WAD621S Lab 4 requirements.

## Features
- **Accessible Form**: Semantic HTML with labeled inputs, keyboard navigation, and an `aria-live` region for feedback.
- **Validation**: Inline error messages for required fields and email format.
- **Profile Cards**: Dynamically generated cards with student details and a remove button.
- **Summary Table**: Synchronized with form submissions and removals.
- **Code Quality**: Clean, commented code with responsive design.
